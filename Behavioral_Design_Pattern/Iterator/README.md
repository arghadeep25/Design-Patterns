## Iterator

The Iterator pattern provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying structure.

### Real-World Analogy
Think of a playlist on a music streaming app:

- You can navigate songs one-by-one (sequential access).
- You donâ€™t need to know how the playlist is stored internally.
- You can rewind, skip, or loop over the songs easily.
