## Abstract Factory

The Abstract Factory design pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It's like having a "factory of factories," where each factory produces a family of related objects.


### Real World Analogy

Scenario
Imagine youâ€™re designing a home automation system that supports different "smart device ecosystems," such as:

- Amazon Alexa Ecosystem.
- Google Home Ecosystem.
  
Each ecosystem has its own set of smart devices:

- Smart Speaker
- Smart Light
- 
You want the client code to work seamlessly with any ecosystem without worrying about the concrete classes of the devices. The Abstract Factory pattern can help achieve this.

```
Client
   |
SmartDeviceFactory (Abstract Factory)
   |--> AlexaDeviceFactory (Concrete Factory)
   |       |--> EchoSpeaker (Concrete Product - SmartSpeaker)
   |       |--> AlexaLight (Concrete Product - SmartLight)
   |
   |--> GoogleDeviceFactory (Concrete Factory)
           |--> NestSpeaker (Concrete Product - SmartSpeaker)
           |--> GoogleLight (Concrete Product - SmartLight)
```

### Problem

### Solution

### Advantages
- Avoid tight coupling between concrete products and client code.
- Single Responsibility Principle. You can extract the product creation code into one place, making the code easier to support.
- You can introduce new variants of products without breaking existing client code.

### Disadvantages
The code may become more complicated than it should be, since a lot of new interfaces and classes are introduced along with the pattern.
