## Adapter

Adapter pattern is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together by wrapping an existing class with a new interface.

### Real World Analogy

Imagine you have a phone charger plug (Adaptee) designed for U.S. outlets, but you are in Europe, where outlets are different (Client). The Adapter is the socket converter that makes them compatible.
